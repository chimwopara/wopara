                                <p>These Terms establish the legal foundation of the relationship between you and fromsupply. They define the rights and obligations of both parties concerning the provision and use of the Services. If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you possess the full legal authority to enter into this agreement and bind that entity to these Terms. In such a case, "you" and "your" will refer to that entity. If you lack such authority, you must not accept these Terms and may not use the Services on behalf of that entity.</p>
                                <h3>1.2. Changes to Terms</h3>
                                <p>The digital landscape and the Services themselves are subject to constant evolution. To adapt to technological advancements, changes in law, and shifts in business practices, fromsupply reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms at any time. We are committed to transparency and will provide you with reasonable advance notice of any material changes that may adversely affect your rights or obligations. Such notice may be provided by posting the updated Terms on our website, sending a notification to the email address associated with your account, or through an in-app alert or other conspicuous method. Your continued access to or use of the Services following the effective date of such changes will constitute your binding acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your sole responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. Non-material changes, such as clarifications or corrections, may be made without advance notice. Furthermore, changes made for urgent reasons, such as to address a security vulnerability, prevent ongoing abuse, or comply with a legal requirement, may become effective immediately without prior notice. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, your sole recourse is to stop using the Services and terminate your account.</p>
